      "I created a website that serves as a blockchain news updater for users. On my website, users can see the latest updates from various crypto exchanges and track the changes of their favorite cryptocurrencies. I built the frame of the website using React and created my own custom hooks to retrieve the blockchain data through an API using the RAPID API service. My website is a helpful resource for anyone interested in staying informed about the constantly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.",

      "I created a website portfolio template specifically for new full stack developers who are looking for job opportunities. My main focus for this project was on the UI/UX aspect, and I am very happy with the final design. I used the React framework and the styled-component library to implement advanced animations and create a visually appealing interface. This template can be used by new full stack developers to showcase their skills and experiences to potential employers. I believe it will be a valuable tool in helping them stand out in a competitive job market.",

      "I wanted to improve my UI/UX skills and found a company whose products I really liked. I decided to undertake a project to create a modern version of their website. This project really challenged my creativity, as I wanted to create a website that was both unique and familiar to the company's existing customers. The most technically challenging part of the project was definitely the animations. There were some animations that I was particularly proud of because I created them from scratch. Overall, I enjoyed the process of redesigning this website and feel that it has helped me improve my UI/UX skills.",

This was my first time using React and styled components, as the company wanted a component-based website. Despite the learning curve, I was able to deliver a website that the company was very happy with. They continue to use it to this day, and have reported that it has helped attract more customers. I am proud of the work I did on this project and believe it was a valuable experience for me as a freelancer.",

      "As a student, for my senior project, I decided to create a web application for Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation that was invented by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. I wanted to use it as a circuit tool, to make it easier for people to experiment with creating different patterns and designs within the simulation.",
